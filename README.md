# Human-Action-Detection
Human Action Detection is a machine learning and deep learning task with different human activities.


Human Action Detection is a machine learning and deep learning task where different human activities (like walking, running, sitting, standing, climbing stairs, etc.) are automatically recognized using data from sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) or videos. The goal is to classify physical actions into predefined categories.

It is widely used in healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, elderly care, security surveillance, and human-computer interaction.
In this project, sensor data (signals like acceleration and rotation) is collected, preprocessed, and then machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees are trained to classify human activities with good accuracy.
